My home lanes
<!--more-->

Bowling is more than just meeting up with your best friends on Monday night for the best darned sport ever invented, it's a way of life.

My home lanes are the storied [Grandview Lanes](https://www.grandviewbowling.com/), which has been serving Vancouver for more than [70 years](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/vancouver-grandview-lanes-70th-anniversary-1.4305193). 

I strongly encourage you to join the Monday Mixed league. Participants pictured below.

I do not recommend 10-pin bowling because it stinks.
